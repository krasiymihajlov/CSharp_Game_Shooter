# CSharp_Asteroid_Shooter

Review: Bombs fall over the whole NY City. 
Your task is to save your town, destroying the bombs before they reach the ground. To do your job you have: 
   - Laser gun which have to hit 3 times the enemie's bomb
   - Rockets destroying the enemie's bombs with 1 shot

Don't miss the Gifts because they give you rockets. Otherwise your rockets may end and it becomes harder and slower to break the enemie's attack.
Dashboard in front of you can help you navigate through the game. There is the statistic for how many rockets do you have. And how many misses you can afford.


How start the game?
Click Clone or Download button and  Download the Zip fail or clone on your computer.In folder AsteroidsGame need to start AsteroidsGame.sln in VisualStudio and when opening need to run with start button(or Ctrl + f5). This is necessary, because the game need to create bin and obj folder with exe fails for easy starting.
When starting ones we are ready and can close the Visual Studio.

Next we need to open the game folder> AsteroidsGame > AsteroidsGame > bin > Debug > AsteroidsGame.exe
