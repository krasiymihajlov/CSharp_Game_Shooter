Review: Bombs fall over the whole NY City. 
Your task is to save your town, destroying the bombs before they reach the ground. To do your job you have: 
   - Laser gun which have to hit 3 times the enemie's bomb
   - Rockets destroying the enemie's bombs with 1 shot

Don't miss the Gifts because they give you rockets. Otherwise your rockets may end and it becomes harder and slower to break the enemie's attack.
Dashboard in front of you can help you navigate through the game. There is the statistic for how many rockets do you have. And how many misses you can afford.
